I graduated in June 2024 with a degree in Econometrics from Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University, focusing on areas such as Financial Econometrics, Econometric Theory, Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Linear Algebra. My mathematical background includes an introductory level of university mathematics.

I presented at various conferences, representing my university and gaining initial academic experience at the undergraduate level. Last of all you are welcome to explore my Github profile as well.
