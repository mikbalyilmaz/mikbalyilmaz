# MUHAMMED İKBAL YILMAZ

## About Me  
I graduated in June 2024 with a degree in Econometrics from Ankara Hacı Bayram Veli University.  
My focus areas include **Financial Econometrics, Econometric Theory, Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis, Time Series Analysis, and Linear Algebra**.  
My mathematical background covers an introductory level of university mathematics.  

During my undergraduate studies, I presented at several conferences, representing my university and gaining initial academic experience.  
I am currently preparing for graduate-level research and continuously improving my knowledge in statistics and econometrics.
